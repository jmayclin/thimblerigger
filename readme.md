# Thimblerigger

This is an implementation of a Connect 4 Solver that was built using the [delightfully written tutorial](http://blog.gamesolver.org/) by Pascal Pons

It was one of the first projects that I attempted in Rust, and someday I hope that a more motivated version of myself will clean things up a bit.

This primary use of this solver is in the Web Assembly component that powers the connect four experience on my personal website, so you can actually see this code in action at [jmayclin.github.io](https://jmayclin.github.io/)

## Naming

I don't entirely remember the reason behind the naming of the repository. I think I was under the impression that the shell game could also be referred to as "thimbles" and then "rigging" the game would make sense because it's an unbeatable AI? I am deeply suspicious of my previous self's reasoning. But good enough for now.
